Happy Birthday!
Well, here you are, another year older and wiser.
Or, at least older! Just kidding.
Age is just a number, and you wear it well.
Remember, you’re not aging; you’re leveling up!
Let’s celebrate with joy and laughter, and maybe a few jokes about getting old.
May your day be as amazing and hilarious as you are, filled with love, joy, and of course, a gigantic cake.
Here’s to many more years of fun, friendship, and unforgettable shenanigans!
