Losing someone we love is one of life's greatest sorrows, and my heart aches for you during this difficult time.
Please know that you are in my thoughts and prayers, and that I am here for you if you need anything at all.
May you find comfort in the memories you shared, and may the love and support of those around you help carry you through this season of grief.
